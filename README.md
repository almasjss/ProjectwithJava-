Update, delete, read or GET methods must be safe only for authenticated users (however, we need to send the token in the header of HTTP request and check the token in java code from the header).



The user using created application has the ability to:

register

login - login user into the app by giving the unique token to each user

log out



The application should perform the following methods:

add - adding a new user

update - updating user info by user id 

delete - deleting existing user by user id

read - get user information by id/name
